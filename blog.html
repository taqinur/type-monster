      <h3 class="blog-question">Question 1:  What are the differences between local storage and session storage?</h3>
      <p class="blog-answer">
        <b>Answer:</b> The main differences are in accessibility and expiration. <br> 1. The  Local storage is accessible in any window or tab that is open to your site. This means if you store some data in local storage on one tab of your browser that same local storage data will be available on all other tabs and windows you have open to that site.
        This differs from session storage which is only available in the current tab you set the session storage data in. <br>
        2. Local storage is the easiest to understand since it never expires. Once you store data in local storage it will stay there until you manually remove it or the user manually removes it.

        Session storage data will expire as soon as you close the tab you are on. This is because session storage is tied to a particular session which is equivalent to a tab so once you close your tab you are closing your session thus all session storage is cleared.

      <h3 class="blog-question">Question 2:  What are the differences between global scope and local scope?</h3>
      <p class="blog-answer">
        <b>Answer:</b> A variable's scope is the range of the script where it is visible. Variables have either global or local scope. A global variable exists only once in a script, and is visible in every function. Modifications to it in one function are permanent and visible to all functions. Unless declared otherwise, all variables in a script are global. Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id. <br>
        A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost. A local variable of the same name declared elsewhere is a different variable. A local variable can even exist multiple times simultaneously, if its block is entered again before it's exited - i.e. a recursive function call. Each call of the function will have a distinct local variable.

      <h3 class="blog-question">Question 3: What is event loop in JavaScript?</h3>
      <p class="blog-answer">
        <b>Answer:</b> An event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to execute a callback function after a given event has occurred. For example, when a user clicks a button on a web page, an event is generated and the event loop will execute the callback function associated with that event. <br>
        Event loops are important because they allow JavaScript to handle events asynchronously. This means that JavaScript can continue to execute code while waiting for an event to occur. This is important because it allows JavaScript to avoid blocking the main thread of execution, which would prevent the web page from responding to user input.

      <h3 class="blog-question">Question 4: What returns undefined value is JavaScript?</h3>
      <p class="blog-answer">
        <b>Answer:</b> The 8 ways for undefined value- 
        <br>1. Value is no initialized<br>
        2. If function is not returned<br>
        3. If the parameter is not passed in a function<br>
        4. If return has no value to return<br>
        5. If the property of an object doesn't exist<br>
        6. Trying to access elements than available index.<br>
        7. Deleting an element inside an array.<br>
        8. Set a value directly to undefined.
