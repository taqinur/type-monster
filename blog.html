      <h3 class="blog-question">Question 1:  What are the differences between local storage and session storage?</h3>
      <p class="blog-answer">
        <b>Answer:</b> The main differences are in accessibility and expiration. <br> 1. The  Local storage is accessible in any window or tab that is open to your site. This means if you store some data in local storage on one tab of your browser that same local storage data will be available on all other tabs and windows you have open to that site.
        This differs from session storage which is only available in the current tab you set the session storage data in. <br>
        2. Local storage is the easiest to understand since it never expires. Once you store data in local storage it will stay there until you manually remove it or the user manually removes it.

        Session storage data will expire as soon as you close the tab you are on. This is because session storage is tied to a particular session which is equivalent to a tab so once you close your tab you are closing your session thus all session storage is cleared.
